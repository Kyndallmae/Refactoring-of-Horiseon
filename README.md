### Title
Refractoring the Horiseon Website

### Description
In this project I was asked to refacto a webpage to contain alt text elementas for the images to make the webpage more accessible, restructure the HTML elements with semantic language, and combing the repeated CSS selectors. 

### What does it do?
This application is marketed for individuals that want to optimize their websites for search engines. Users will be able to use this application to make their website appear higher in the results of a search engine. 

### What did you use?
For this refactoring project, I used a combination of VS Code, Terminal, Github, and Chrome DevTools to complete this project. 

### Challenges faced?
I faced some challenges with adding the semantic HTML elements when deciding where to keep the <div> elements and where to add sematic language. I also had to research how to combine CSS selectors and was able to complete it in the end.
